# *It* Download and Installation

*It* works under MacOS, Windows, and Linux. See the appropriate section for installation instructions on your platform.

## MacOS
*It* is supported for MacOS versions 11 (Big Sur) or newer. 
Binaries support both Apple Silicon (M1, M2, ...) and older Intel-based machines.

### Prerequisites
You must have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. On MacOS, this is 
done by opening a terminal and typing:
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
and following the on-screen instructions.

### Installation Instructions:
- Download [It.dmg](doc/It.dmg)
- Open the .dmg
- Drag It.app into the application folder (or anywhere else if you prefer)
- Double-click It.app to open it.

The first time you open *It*, you will be prompted to select a directory for
for your files. Select any directory you see fit. 

> Notice that if you had earlier versions
> of *It* installed on your machine, and if you have a directory `~/Library/Application Support/It`, this directory will be used.
> If this is not what you intended, use the File > Set Files Directory option.

## Windows
*It* supports Windows 11 - it may work on other versions but has not been tested.

### Prerequisites
You must have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. We strongly recommend installing the [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). You should at least download support for C++ development. *It* assumes that you are using the MSVCC 2022 compiler.
